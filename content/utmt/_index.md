title: UndertaleModTool
---

UndertaleModTool is, despite its name, a general purpose GameMaker modding utility. It is thus currently the best choice for modding AM2R. This means, that GameMaker knowledge is not only helpful, but often times necessary. If you're new, or not up to speed, feel free to check out the [basics](basics) page.  
It can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases  
Note, that this wiki will primarily cover the GUI (Graphical User Interface) version, which is *only* available for Windows. Linux is able to run it with some WINE workarounds, but Mac has not had any testing whatsoever regarding it. A CLI (Command Line Interface) version of the tool exists, but it requires technical know-how and is more intended for automation.
