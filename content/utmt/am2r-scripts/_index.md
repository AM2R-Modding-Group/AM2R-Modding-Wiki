title: Custom AM2R Scripts
---

There are a few AM2R specific UndertaleModTool scripts you can use to make your life easier.  
To use these, create a folder called `AM2R` in the `Scripts` directory where you have UndertaleModTool installed. Then place the scripts from down below into that `AM2R` folder.

{{<todo>}} make scripts available from zip {{</todo>}}

After you have done that, you can call any of these scripts from UndertaleModTool, by clicking on the `Script` Menu on the top, and then selecting your script from the `AM2R` option.
