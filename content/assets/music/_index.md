{{<todo>}} should the music files be embedded here for quick listen/download? or is the soundcloud enough? {{</todo>}}
This subsection documents the various music tracks used in AM2R.  
The music is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 and can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/user-64632134/sets/am2r-original-soundtrack  
The official Soundtrack tracks were created by Milton Guasti, Darren Kerwin and Torbj√∏rn Brandrud.  
The music assets have the prefix `mus` and have the same name as the music file names listed here, but without the extension (e.g. `musTitle` instead of `musTitle.ogg`).  
Be aware, that on Unix systems (Linux, Android, macOS) the music file names are all lowercase, due to the way GameMaker loads them.
