This subsection documents the various shaders used in AM2R. Shader assets have the prefix `sh`.
{{<todo>}} Am2r 1.0 used a shader for gravity suit. document that one more{{</todo>}}
AM2R 1.0 uses a shader internally known as `shReplaceColor`. Not much is known about it, but Rivals of Aether also has a similar if not the same shader. It seems to originate from GMLscripts.com, but it also could've been a shader shipped with old GameMaker versions or from GMC. DoctorM64 did not write it himself.


The Community Updates uses two shaders:
## Pixelated Pope's Retro Palette Swapper
Internally known as `shPaletteSwap`. It can be found for free here: https://pixelatedpope.itch.io/retro-palette-swapper. Note that for the versions 1.5.5 and lower, you want to use the `Retro Pal Swapper 2.1 for GMS1` asset.

## PixHammer's GameBoy Shader
Internally known as `shGameBoy`. It can be bought for 2$ here: https://pixhammer.itch.io/gameboy-shader.
