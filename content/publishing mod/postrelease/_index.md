title: Niceties after Release
weight: 4

These are a few niceties you can do after you have released your Mod to the public.

- Make a thread on the [AM2R Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YTQnkAJ). You probably have already done that during development, but if you haven't,
you should do it in order to see feedback/criticism/experience for your mod in an easy way.

- Add your Mod to the [Unofficial AM2R Mod List here](https://gitlab.com/Miepee/AM2R-Mods/)
    - In order to do that, create an Account on GitLab (you can also login with your GitHub account), click on `Readme.md`, click on the `Open in Web IDE` button, 
add your mod into the file, scroll down at the bottom and insert a comment, then finally click on "Propose changes"
    - If you don't want to create a GitLab account, ask in the communication channels whether someone can add it for you

- Use the Issue tracker on GitHub/GitLab/etc. to easily track issues and feature requests.

- Make a post on the Subreddit/YouTube about your Mod.

- If you have made a Linux release, advertize Steam Deck compatibility.

- Make it possible to install your Mod via a Termux script. This benefits people who only have an Android phone.

- Upload the code for your Mod. This is a little bit more convoluted, and will thus get its own section down below.

### Publish the Code for your Mod
