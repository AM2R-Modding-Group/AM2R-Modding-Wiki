title: Make your Mod AM2RLauncher compatible
---

In order to make your Mod AM2RLauncher compatible, you will need to use 
[Atomic](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/Atomic).  
The instructions are as follows:  

1. Download the [latest version of the Atomic](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/Atomic/releases/latest).  
Choose the version for your OS.

2. Extract the zip to a folder of your liking. I'll call that folder "ExtractedPacker" for future reference.

3. Execute the tool in your ExtractedPacker folder, and fill everything out accordingly.
    - The name, author, version and mod notes will all be shown in the AM2RLauncher. The mod name is used to differentiate different mods
    - Check (and select accordingly) the `Uses custom save directory` option, if your mod (on **Desktop**) uses a different save directory than
 `%localappdata%/AM2R`
    - Check the `Uses custom music` option, if your mod uses different music than the AM2R Community Updates
    - Check (and select accordingly) the `Supports [OS]` if you have a Raw Mod zip for that OS available

4. Click the `Load 1.1` button and select your AM2R 1.1 file

5. Click on the `Create Mod Packages` button, and select the places you want your AM2RLauncher compatible mods to be saved at.

Now you will have AM2RLauncher compatible Mods. I'll call these "AM2RLauncher Mod" for future reference.
