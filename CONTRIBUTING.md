# Contributing

If you only want to fix small typos or add a bit of text, you don't have to download the project to work on it locally. Clicking the `Edit page` button at the right of a page will open a link where you can add your changes.

## Working on the codebase locally
This repository is a Hugo project. Thus you should approximately know how to deal with Hugo sites. If you don't, you can read their documentation here: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/  
In addition, this project uses the Geekdocs theme, whose features you can see here: https://geekdocs.de/usage/getting-started/

If you don't have the time to read through the hugo documentation, a shorthand version is:
- Install Hugo. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/installation).
- Git clone the project. Installation instructions for git can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Open a terminal, navigate to the folder you cloned it in, and run a local web server with `hugo server`.

Actual website content can be found in the `content` folder.
