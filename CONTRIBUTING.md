This repository is a Hugo project. Thus you should approximately know how to deal with Hugo sites, if you don't you can read their documentation here: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/  
In addition, this project uses the Geekdocs theme, whose features you can see here: https://geekdocs.de/usage/getting-started/

If you don't have the time to read through the hugo documentation, a shorthand version is:
- Install Hugo
- Git clone the projet
- Navigate to the folder you cloned it in, and run a local web server with `hugo server`.

Actual website content can be found in the `content` folder.
