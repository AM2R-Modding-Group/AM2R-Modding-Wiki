Here are manuals for a few versions:\nGameMaker Studio 1.4: https://dobby233liu.github.io/gms1.4docs-recreation/\nRelevant for AM2R versions 1.5.5 and earlier. GameMaker Studio 2.2: https://dobby233liu.github.io/gms2.2docs/\nPotentially relevant for AM2R version 1.6. Latest GameMaker: https://manual.yoyogames.com/\nShouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any relevancy to AM2R for now, but it\u0026rsquo;s good keeping in mind. The site automatically updates to changes of newer GamerMaker versions. A GameMaker game is split into multiple different resources, which all can be named.\nThe resource tree in GameMaker Studio 1.4 The resource tree in UndertaleModTool Sprites These are collection of images. A sprite can have multiple subimages (frames), which can create an animation. They can be attached as a visual representation of objects, or drawn directly.\nSounds These are audio clips. They can be embedded inside the game, or loaded from disk, and also have different compression option. You usually adjust these based on whether you want a sound asset to play a short sound effect, or music.\nBackgrounds These are large non-animated images. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting, that in GameMaker Studio 1.4, tilesets are also just backgrounds.\nPaths These are lines defined by X and Y coordinates. AM2R does not use these, but it\u0026rsquo;s useful to know about them.\nScripts These are essentially code entries that you can call anywhere. GameMaker does not otherwise allow you to name your own functions (although later versions of GameMaker have implemented that functionality)\nShaders These are small pieces of code that run on the GPU to modify how pixels are drawn on the screen. These are programmed in different shader languages, usually GLSL ES.\nFonts As the name suggests, these are fonts. They\u0026rsquo;re implemented slightly differently as one would usually think - you have to define which characters you want to include at which size, and GameMaker will then store images of the characters at your defined sizes.\nTimelines These allow you to have code run after a specific amount of time has passed.\nObjects These are essentially \u0026ldquo;actors\u0026rdquo;, or if you\u0026rsquo;re coming from other programming languages, you can think of them as \u0026ldquo;Classes\u0026rdquo;. An object has certain attributes: the sprite it uses, whether it\u0026rsquo;s visible, the code it executes when certain events happen and so on. You are then able to place instances of them into rooms. Imagine the object like a blueprint, and the instances like a creation from that blueprint.\nRooms These are seperately defined spaces in your game. They have a width, height, and can have instances of objects, tiles, backgrounds and more.\nExtensions These are essentially externally defined libraries. If you had written a small set of useful string manipulation methods, you were able to use them as extensions in your projects, rather than redefine them every time. AM2R doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any, and most GameMaker projects will usually not use any due to the complications they bring.\nIn addition, UndertaleModTool also exposes some internal resources. TODO: explain the rest. texture page items, code, variables, functions, code locals, strings, embedded textures and audio GameMaker games are coded in GML (GameMaker Language), whose syntax is similar to JavaScript. There are a few places where you can use it:\nScripts: More or less user defined functions. Events: Objects can have specific moments (events), that will run code. Creation Code: Code that gets run when rooms get loaded or when object instances get created. For new GML coders, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to read the GML Overview in order to get familiar with the language.\nIt is worth noting, that when dealing with code in UndertaleModTool, there are a few things to look out for. It tries to decompile and and compile code from GML into bytecode. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work perfectly, so (de)compiling errors may happen. UndertaleModTool compiling the code also means that some code elements (like whitespace, comments or some if expressions) will be optimized away.\n","description":"As UndertaleModTool mods GameMaker games, having GameMaker resources up at hand is often times very useful.

For this, there are two main steps; Setting up collision and tiling. It is generally recommended to do tiling first, as UTMT will always put the visuals for collision blocks in the foreground, meaning that doing tiling afterwards is a horrible experience. To give your room form, you can place tiles from the many different tilesets. Each tile is added individually by right clicking in the tiles section, selecting add new tile, and then dragging the tileset that you want to use over from the left into the definition. This will be a slow process. Each unit or block that represents a tile is 16x16 pixels pixels large, and can be selected manually by setting the source position and size or selected automatically by clicking on the tile you want. However the latter option is sometimes not as good for tilesets which aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to blocks. It is helpful to use an image editor to find the coordinates of specific points for the former option. Tiles that are a multiple of 16x16 can be selected by holding ALT while dragging over the tileset thumbnail in the tile\u0026rsquo;s properties. Take note of the depth variable when adding tiles. Since UTMT does not have a layer system, this value is what decides which tiles are in the foreground and which are in the background, with lower values being shown in front of higher values.\nHere are some depth values to take note of:\nBackgrounds: 100 Samus: -1 Foreground: -100 Breakable Blocks: -111/-112 Fading Tiles: -120 (Do not work without an oFadeTiles object) Something you can use to make the tiling process a lot faster is to duplicate existing tiles by holding ALT while click-dragging them in the room preview. This will copy everything from that tile, including depth and tileset. This drastically speeds up the tiling process, as you then don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually assign the same values to every tile.^ It is recommended to start with the tiles that the player will interact with, then adding stuff outside the playable area and lastly the background decorations.\nFirst we start with the tiles the player is meant to interact with. Then we add the out of bounds tiles. And finally the decoration and background tiles. Now we can begin adding collision. For this we will use objects, in particular oSolid1 and oSlope(1-4). On the left Filter by name... box, search for solid. Here you will find all types of solids, though for most purposes, oSolid1 will be all you need. You can add it by dragging the object into the room, placing it where you want it, and optionally scale it to fit your needs. For sloped surfaces you can use the oSlope(1-4) and oSlope(1-4)B objects. Do not rotate these, instead, if the slope doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the correct orientation, take a slope with a different number and drag it into the definition box of your selected slope until you find the one with the right orientation. Be careful when deleting objects. If there was any code that still referenced the object, expect crashes or other breakage in-game. Our room with added solids and slopes For puzzles and other uses, you can also search for missile, bomb, smissile and other destroyable blocks. Keep in mind that these blocks, as well as solid blocks, are invisible and do not appear without putting tiles over them or giving them creation code. For this, there are two solutions:\nAdd creation code for each of them and use tile_link(tileset,x,y) as its content. It will link the block to a tileset and automatically use a 16 x 16 size. The x and y coordinates correspond with the top-left corner of the breakable block. Place a tile in the position where the breakable block will be, and set the depth of that tile to either -111 or -112. Here are all the breakable Blocks, along with what they are commonly refered to:\noBlockShoot; Beam blocks oBlockStep; Crumble blocks oBlockBomb; Bomb blocks oBlockMissile; Missile blocks oBlockSMissile; Super Missile Blocks oBlockSpeed; Speedboost Blocks oBlockPBomb; Power bomb blocks oBlockScrew; Screw attack blocks Some breakables (namely Shoot, Bomb and PBomb) also have Chain Variants.\nNote that there are still tiles behind the bomb blocks, set at depth \u0026#34;-111\u0026#34; For backgrounds, you should place an oBackground object somewhere in the room. Usually they are placed in the top-left of the room. The oBackground needs creation code to function. Without it, the game will crash when trying to load the room. Right click on Code in the viewer on the left side and then click add. This will open a blank text window. As with rooms, object creation code follows a naming convention, starting with gml_RoomCC_, followed by the name of the room the object is located in (in our case it would be rm_a1a13), which is then followed by the code entry\u0026rsquo;s ID (the number that automatically generates when you first add your code element, in our case 9808) and finally _Create. For the actual code itself, we only need one line to make the oBackground object function: load_bgset(value), where value decides what background will be used.\nIf you want to check what value corresponds to what background, open the gml_Script_load_bgset script. Here you will see if conditions in the format of if (argument0 == value). Inside the code block following these condition, there will be a line with bgid[0]. CTRL click on the number after the = and select the entry that has with UndertaleBackground in brackets. If you then CTRL click on it again, you will be taken to a separate page, showing you what background belongs to the value of that if condition. Alternatively, you can always check an existing oBackground in a room that has the background that you want, and just take the value from there.\nThe create code for our oBackground Remember to actually attach the creation code to the object you created it for. Objects like oBackground will not function properly and crash without them when you try to load the room they are located in. While you can\u0026#39;t see the background in the editor... ...it will show up in game. Now, your room has tiles, collision objects, breakable blocks and a parallax background! You could even test it out in game right now, but currently you cannot get into your room. For this we will need transitions.\n","description":"Now we get to actually laying out and \u0026ldquo;building\u0026rdquo; your room.

This is approximately how the room should look after the preparation Once you have your set room size click on one of the (no name) elements under the backgrounds tab.

Manual version should be kept for completeness. Finally, we are up to transitions. These are the oGotoRoom objects that allow you to go to other rooms, and they take quite a bit of time to prepare to be visually appealing. Bad transitions end up with teleporting Samuses across the screen and the camera moving strangely. However, with the right knowledge, it can be done very quickly. Each transition requires a lot of number fiddling in the creation code. The essential values needed are: targetroom, direction, height, targetx, targety, camstartx, camstarty, transitionx, transitiony.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a description of what you should assign to them:\ntargetroom = The room number of the room you are transitioning into. Entering the name of the room will automatically make UTMT convert it into its number ID. direction = A number for what direction Samus is travelling in. 0 for Right. 90 for Up. 180 for Left. 270 for Down. height = The size of the transition. Depends on direction. If the transition is going Right or Left, this number is how tall the transition is. This means the optimal location to place the transition is at the bottom of the entrance, directly on a collision block. If the direction is going Up or Down, this variable is how wide the transition is, starting from its origin (its centre) going towards the right. Optimal placement is placing this directly on the right of the leftmost wall the transition is between. targetx = The x coordinate of where Samus is in the next room you are transitioning to. targety = The y coordinate of where Samus is in the room you are transitioning to. camstartx = The x coordinate of the camera\u0026rsquo;s centre in the next room. camstarty = The y coordinate of the camera\u0026rsquo;s centre in the next room. transitionx = x coordinate of where Samus is during the transition cutscene relative to the camera\u0026rsquo;s origin. This has a range of 0-320. Do not go above or below it. transitiony = y coordinate of where Samus is during the transition cutscene relative to the camera\u0026rsquo;s origin. This has a range of 0-240. Do not go above or below it. Optimal placing for up and down transitions Optimal placing for left and right transitions At this point with at least targetroom and targetx and targety and direction set, the transition should now work.\nNext are some tips to help smoothen out the transition:\ntargetx and targety = If Samus is in the air, try use the x and y coordinates of the floor tile you want her to end up on after the cutscene. Since the floor tiles have origins on the top-left of their image, and Samus will end up on them and not in the air above them. camstartx and camstarty = After testing the transition cutscene once, I try and find the midpoint of where it is on my screen in-game in reference to any nearby tiles or objects. This will take some trial and error to get right. transitionx and transitiony = This will also take some trial and error to get right. Essentially what I do is I take the midpoint and I either subtract or add a quarter of the room size\u0026rsquo;s x and y values depending on where I want Samus to end up in during the transition before actually going through it. After going through the transition, and finding out how terribly Samus is offset, I add or subtract from the values by 16 (essentially one block) to help get closer to the preferred final destination of where Samus is during the cutscene. This is easier to understand in practice, hopefully. Congratulations! You have a functional room with transitions, collision units, tiles, background, and a camera! Feel free to add your own objects in and whatever you feel is necessary.\n","description":"TODO: there\u0026rsquo;s a helper script to automatically generate these transitions value., should be referenced and used here.
