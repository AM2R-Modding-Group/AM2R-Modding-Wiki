Also fix some phrasing.\nPreparation: When creating a new room, the dimensions must be multiples of 320 x 240. Having different room dimensions will cause lots of troubles. Also make sure that the room\u0026rsquo;s room speed is set to 60 as that\u0026rsquo;s what AM2R runs at. Entering different values will lead to the room being slowed-down or sped up.\nOnce you have your set room size, set a background by putting bgScreenGuide in one of the background definitions by dragging and dropping it from the left. Enable the background afterwards.\nNext, click on the Views category, and then click on the first View. Set its Pos/size values to 0, 0, 320, 240, regardless of room size. Set the Port pos/size values to 0, 0, 320, 240 as well. Set Border values to 160, 160. Make sure Speed values are at -1, -1. Lastly, to make the camera follow the player, put oCamera into the Follows object box.\nYou are now ready to start building your room. On the left Filter by name... box, search for solid. There, all the solid collision blocks under the Game objects category are to be added by dragging and dropping them onto the room. For puzzles and other uses, you can also search for missile, bomb, super missile and other destroyable blocks. Keep in mind that these blocks, as well as solid blocks, are invisible and do not appear without putting tiles over them or giving them creation code.\nNow, your room\u0026rsquo;s collision and destroyable blocks are all layed out. In-game, you will see nothing in your room, but you will able to collide with the blocks and break them as usual. To give your room form, you can put tiles from the many different tilesets. Each tile is added individually, so this will be a slow process. Each unit or block that represents a tile is 16 x 16 pixels large, and can be selected manually by setting the source position and size or clicking on what tile you want, however the latter option is sometimes not as good for tilesets that aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to blocks. It is recommended to use an image editor to find the coordinates of specific points for the former option. Tiles that are a multiple of 16x16 can be selected by holding ALT while click-dragging over the tileset thumbnail in the tile\u0026rsquo;s properties. Before we get into backgrounds, you are wondering what to do with the destroyable blocks since they do not appear visible, or even the fact you cannot get into the room at all. The room requires a oGotoRoom object (from now on called \u0026ldquo;transitions\u0026rdquo;) to actually enter it from anywhere else. Breakable blocks need creation code to make them look like different blocks. You should NOT put tiles over them if your intent is to have them break. Transitions will be covered later.\nFor the breakable blocks, there are two solutions:\nAdd creation code for each of them and use tile_link(tileset,x,y) as its content. It will link the block to a tileset and will automatically use a 16 x 16 size. The x and y coordinates correspond with the top-left corner of the breakable block. Place a tile in the position where the breakable block will be, and set the depth of that tile to either -111 or -112. Now you can add breakable blocks in your room!\nFor backgrounds, you should place an oBackground object somewhere in the room. Usually they are placed in the top-left of the room. The oBackground object has create code load_bgset(value). The value is the set of backgrounds the object will use. For example, load_bgset(7) will put the Area 4 background sprites in the background. The best way to determine this is finding an oBackground object in a different room in the same area as yours or the area your prefer and copying it or its creation code to yours. Your room now has a background with parallax movement!\nTODO: above is false, you can easily check what value is used for load_bgset by checking the appropriate script, and then ctrl+clicking the number next to bgid[0] under the argument0 == value condition.\nFinally, we are up to transitions. These are the oGotoRoom objects that allow you to go to other rooms, and they take quite a bit of time to prepare to be visually appealing. Bad transitions end up with teleporting Samuses across the screen and the camera moving strangely. However, with the right knowledge, it can be done very quickly. Each transition requires a lot of number fiddling in the creation code. The essential values needed are: targetroom, direction, height, targetx, targety, camstartx, camstarty, transitionx, transitiony.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a description of what you should assign to them:\ntargetroom = The room number of the room you are transitioning into. Entering the name of the room will automatically make UTMT convert it into its number ID. direction = A number for what direction Samus is travelling in. 0 for Right. 90 for Up. 180 for Left. 270 for Down. height = The size of the transition. Depends on direction. If the transition is going Right or Left, this number is how tall the transition is. This means the optimal location to place the transition is at the bottom of the entrance, directly on a collision block. If the direction is going Up or Down, this variable is how wide the transition is, starting from its origin (its centre) going towards the right. Optimal placement is placing this directly on the right of the leftmost wall the transition is between. targetx = The x coordinate of where Samus is in the next room you are transitioning to. targety = The y coordinate of where Samus is in the room you are transitioning to. camstartx = The x coordinate of the camera\u0026rsquo;s centre in the next room. camstarty = The y coordinate of the camera\u0026rsquo;s centre in the next room. transitionx = x coordinate of where Samus is during the transition cutscene relative to the camera\u0026rsquo;s origin. This has a range of 0-320. Do not go above or below it. transitiony = y coordinate of where Samus is during the transition cutscene relative to the camera\u0026rsquo;s origin. This has a range of 0-240. Do not go above or below it. Optimal placing for up and down transitions Optimal placing for left and right transitions At this point with at least targetroom and targetx and targety and direction set, the transition should now work.\nNext are some tips to help smoothen out the transition:\ntargetx and targety = If Samus is in the air, try use the x and y coordinates of the floor tile you want her to end up on after the cutscene. Since the floor tiles have origins on the top-left of their image, and Samus will end up on them and not in the air above them. camstartx and camstarty = After testing the transition cutscene once, I try and find the midpoint of where it is on my screen in-game in reference to any nearby tiles or objects. This will take some trial and error to get right. transitionx and transitiony = This will also take some trial and error to get right. Essentially what I do is I take the midpoint and I either subtract or add a quarter of the room size\u0026rsquo;s x and y values depending on where I want Samus to end up in during the transition before actually going through it. After going through the transition, and finding out how terribly Samus is offset, I add or subtract from the values by 16 (essentially one block) to help get closer to the preferred final destination of where Samus is during the cutscene. This is easier to understand in practice, hopefully. Congratulations! You have a functional room with transitions, collision units, tiles, background, and a camera! Feel free to add your own objects in and whatever you feel is necessary.\n","description":"TODO: having some more screenshots in here would be nice.
